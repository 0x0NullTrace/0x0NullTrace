​Digital Forensics Specialist | Windows Internals Expert

​Digital Forensics Investigator specializing in Windows ecosystems. I possess the technical depth to interrogate system infrastructures and extract digital evidence that adversaries believe is permanently erased. Operating at the intersection of technology and law, I transform complex binary data into undeniable forensic facts while maintaining a rigorous Chain of Custody in compliance with NIST and ISO 27037 standards.

​🚀 Advanced Operational Capabilities

​Advanced Memory Forensics: Dissecting RAM to detect fileless malware and threats that leave no trace on the disk. Analysis includes active processes, encryption key recovery, process injection detection, and VAD (Virtual Address Descriptor) analysis.

​Windows Registry Forensics: Deep interrogation of Registry Hives to identify persistence mechanisms, UserAssist execution counts, MRU lists, and precise network/user configurations.

​Low-Level File System Analysis: Analyzing NTFS architecture via $MFT, $LogFile, and $UsnJrnl. Expertise in block-level reconstruction and advanced Data Carving to recover files even after disk formatting.

​User Artifacts Analysis: Full timeline reconstruction of user activity by analyzing Prefetch, ShimCache, Amcache, Jump Lists, and ShellBags.
​
Anti-Forensics Countermeasures: Detecting Timestomping by comparing MFT time attributes ($10 vs $30) and identifying attempts to clear logs or use rootkits.

​Expert Forensic Reporting: Crafting technical reports that correlate fragmented evidence into a comprehensive crime scenario, ensuring data integrity through cryptographic hashing.
